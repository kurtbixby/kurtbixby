# Greetings

Hi, my name's Kurt. I'm a software developer currently focused on creating full-stack web applications with an emphasis on backend systems.

## Skills

My main programming environment is C# + .NET with JavaScript being a close secondary. I've also written software in C++, Python, and other languages, and I'm currently dipping my toes into Rust.

## Projects

- **[Plunger](https://github.com/kurtbixby/plunger)**
A full-stack web app I wrote this to replace the spreadsheet I use to track and manage my video game collection. It currently supports adding games that appear in the [Internet Games Database](https://www.igdb.com/) to a collection. It also collates and tracks duplicate versions of games that might exist in a collection. It's built using React on the frontend and C# backend.

## Demos

- **[Literate Waffle](https://github.com/kurtbixby/literate-waffle-mysql-frontend)**
An extensible and reusable CLI for managing entities in a SQL database. It uses an MVC-like architecture to stay simple. Menu options are associated with functions that handle logic surrounding database queries. The dbInterface class defines and exports functions that call stored procedures located in the database.
